Welcome! This is my web app resume attempt of the Cloud Resume Challenge using Microsoft Azure and modern DevOps & frontend technologies. This project leverages infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD pipelines, serverless computing, and static site hosting all in one full-stack cloud application.

This challenge has been a great opportunity to package my experience into a neat website, essentially my professional portfolio. I had fun! I'm grateful the challegne allowed me to improve my Python, Bash, Terraform, and GitHub Actions scripting skills. Troubleshooting through Azure Function deployments, resource permission issues, and configuring persistent backend logic taught me more than any course could. I also gained a much deeper appreciation for how interconnected cloud services can be. If you're interested, I'd be happy to break down the project for you in more detail.
